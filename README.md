# Silent Narrator 🎧📸

**Silent Narrator** is a unique system designed to turn still images into auditory experiences. The system extracts visual features from images and translates them into auditory attributes.The project aims to explore new sensory experiences by allowing users to "hear" the visual content through sound.

## How It Works ⚙️
1. **Upload Image**: User uploads an image using the Streamlit UI.
2. **Image Analysis**: The uploaded image is processed by the CLIP model to determine its visual attributes.
3. **Mood Detection**: Based on the extracted features, the system determines the mood of the image (e.g., happy, calm, energetic).
4. **Music Matching**: The system connects to the Spotify API and fetches music that best matches the detected mood.
5. **Audio Playback**: Users can listen to the suggested music directly from the web interface.
